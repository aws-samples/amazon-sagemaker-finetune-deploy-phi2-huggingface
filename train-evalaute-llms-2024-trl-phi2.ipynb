Evaluations against benchmarks for common sense, language understanding, and logical reasoning indicate that Phi-2 achieves nearly state-of-the-art performance among models with fewer than 13 billion parameters.\n",

Verster revealed that by June, the software will be undergoing its seventh iteration due to ongoing defects. Verster noted that while major construction is largely complete, there are still minor tasks remaining, such as addressing water leaks or fixing broken tiles. However, his primary concern lies with the software defects affecting the signalling and train control system, which are being addressed by contractors CTS and Alstom.
